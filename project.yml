  This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. A DataCamp project will allow you to practice and 
  apply the skills you've learned in the DataCamp courses. In each project you will carry out an 
  end-to-end analysis, on a real-world task, using real-world tools and workflows. 
  In this gentle introduction to DataCamp projects, we will walk you through the projects
  interface and you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: 
  an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.
